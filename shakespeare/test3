The wind was gentle, brushing against the meadow.
The wind was furious, tearing through the streets.
The wind was gentle, barely moving the tree leaves.
The wind was restless, tapping at the windows.
The wind was cold, wrapping the night in silence.
The stars were bright, scattered across the velvet sky.
The stars were distant, yet strangely comforting.
The stars were bright, guiding sailors through the dark.
The stars were silent, watching over the world below.
The stars were eternal, never ceasing to shine.
