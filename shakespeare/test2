The wind whispered through the tall grass.
The wind howled across the empty plains.
The wind whispered secrets to the silent trees.
The wind carried the scent of the sea.
The wind rattled the windows in short bursts.
The stars glimmered above the sleeping town.
The stars burned with quiet intensity.
The stars glimmered in the reflection of the lake.
The stars danced behind a veil of clouds.
The stars shimmered like diamonds in velvet.
